                    <div class="articles">
                        Lionel Messi is a professional soccer player from Argentina who plays as a forward for the
                        French Ligue 1 team Paris Saint-Germain and also captions the Argentina national team. He is
                        regarded as the best soccer player in the world of all time. He has won a record six
                        Ballon d'Or awards and record six European Golden Shoes. Unitl recently, he spent almost
                        his entire life playing for FC Barcelona in Spain, where he won a club-record 35 trophies.

                        Born and raised in central Argentina, Messi relocated to Spain to join Barcelona at age 13,
                        for whom he made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an
                        integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season
                        in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22,
                        Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning four
                        consecutive Ballons d'Or, making him the first player to win the award four times and in a row.
                        During the 2011–12 season, he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a
                        single season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two
                        seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival),
                        before regaining his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer
                        in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a
                        fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and in 2019 he won a
                        record sixth Ballon d'Or.

                    <h2>Comparison to Cristiano Ronaldo</h2>
                    <div class="articles">
                        Among his contemporary peers, Messi is most often compared and contrasted with Portuguese
                        forward Cristiano Ronaldo. Although Messi has at times denied any rivalry,
                        they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the
                        world: since 2008, Messi has won six Ballons d'Or to Ronaldo's five, six FIFA World's
                        Best Player awards to Ronaldo's five, and six European Golden Shoes to Ronaldo's four.
                        Pundits and fans regularly argue the individual merits of both players; beyond their
                        playing styles, the debate also revolves around their differing physiques – Ronaldo is
                        1.87 m (6 ft 1+1⁄2 in) with a muscular build – and contrasting public personalities,
                        with Ronaldo's self-confidence and theatrics a foil to Messi's humility.
                        From 2009–10 to 2017–18, Messi faced Ronaldo at least twice every season in El Clásico,
                        which ranks among the world's most viewed annual sports events. Off the pitch, Ronaldo
                        is his direct competitor in terms of salary, sponsorships, and social media fanbase.
